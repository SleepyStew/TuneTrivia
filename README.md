## Information
TuneTrivia is a private bot turned public. There may be reminents of development left behind.
If you want to help develop or add features to TuneTrivia, absolutely feel free to do so. If you think your additions for the bot, make sure to make a PR.
The code isn't the cleanest but I hope most of it is reasnobly self explanatory. I may add comments in the future to help out new developers.
